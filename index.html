<p class="home-desc">Thoughts, feelins' and rants. I love to talk about anything from Web Development to Philosophy. This blog is intended to be a source for my entertainment and experimentation but if it somehow finds its way to another set of eyes and my words bring insight to the reader that's cool too.</p>
<ul class="posts cw">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <p class='published'>{{ post.date | date: "%-d %B %Y" }}</p>
      <h4><a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h4>
      <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
      <a class="btn btn-danger" href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}">Read</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}

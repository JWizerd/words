Name is Jeremiah. I'm a web developer, photographer, person-thing. This blog exists because there are moments in my life that I feel the need to write something and put it out into the world. Like a note in a bottle I push an idea out to the sea of information not really concerned if anyone ever sees it. This blog is for my enjoyment and through it I will achieve personal growth, learn new things about all sort of topics and most importantly learn more about myself. I think that last part is something that today most people don't have time for and it's ***so damn important***. I know lately in my life I've had a hell of a time connecting on a deeper level with myself. From trying to run a business to health issues and of course the wonderful world of ***probation*** and the weekly feeling of being violated as someone watches my piss into a cup (**more on that later**). But for real, I wanted to make a short and sweet introduction to say...
